# Pen-Ur-Blog

Your directory to the blog file should be "C:\xampp\htdocs\blog". <BR> <BR>
You have to create an account first before accessing the registered user privileges. (You can't just type the URL) <BR> <BR>
If you want an access as an admin, change your "is_admin" role from users table in blog.sql to "1".
